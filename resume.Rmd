# Professional Summary
- Develop bioinformatics tools specializing in applying ML to large omics datasets using R, Python, and Bash/shell
- Use large, public databases (e.g., BV-BRC, NCBI, InterPro) with applied machine learning to study the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes
- Mentored 3 PhD students and 1 undergraduate student
- Developed a protein analysis web-app [MolEvolvR](http://jravilab.org/molevolvr/?r=&p=home)
- Presented research talks and workshops at international conferences, hosted department-wide workshops, and presented research posters
- Exceptional IT knowledge: experienced with high performance computing (HPC), version control (GitHub), dependency management, containerization, package development, web-application hosting, using web APIs for data, etc.
- Basic familiarity of other common languages like Javascript, C, Java, and Perl
- Apply statistical methods to analyze omics data: supervised classification, fisher's test, under/over-sampling, cross-validation, rank-based hypothesis testing, etc
- Assist in various sub-tasks throughout the lab such as one-on-one mentorship with undergraduates and graduate students

# Peer-Mentees

- Jill Bilodeaux; 2023 (Computational Biosciences program; CU Anschutz)
- Charmie Vang; 2023 (Biophysical Sciences program; CU Anschutz)

**Undergraduates**

# Project summaries

**Machine learning-based classification of antimicrobial resistance**:

- Project lead, first author
- Developed a computational pipeline to gather bacterial genomes and AMR data from public databases, featurize the genomes, develop ML models to classify AMR, and analyze top predictors to discover novel AMR genes
- Mentored 3 PhD students and 1 undergraduate to assist in omics data featurization, model development, and model outcome analysis
- Supervised learning with large (over 10k bacterial isolates) sample sizes and tackling class imbalance with weighted loss functions and undersampling
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, auROC, etc.
- Implemented Fisher's Exact test for nearly a million genes to determine significant presence/absence in the binary classes (resistant/susceptible phenotypes) yielding ranked gene lists for AMR contribution
- Developed the omics data featurization, ML, and non-ML pipelines as Bioconductor R package with planned submission in early 2024
\newline
\newline
  - All source code for data wrangling, machine learning, and presentation is already installable as an R package on https://github.com/jravilab/amR (private until submission)
- Planned submission for datasets and results to Bioconductor's ExperimentHub in early 2024
- Future directions:
  - Build a sequence database of top resistance genes by clustering across species to address the uninterprebility of gene cluster assignment across species using species-wise pangenomics tools
  - Design a web-application to showcase results of ML models in classifying AMR for various drugs/species
  - Design a web-application which allows submission of bacterial genomes for AMR classification
